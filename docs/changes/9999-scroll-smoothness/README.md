This pack tracks the current scroll-smoothness investigation and first-wave
implementation for embedded Ghostty history scrolling.

Current state:

- render-callback/direct-draw scheduling is in place for the
  `GHOSTTY_ACTION_RENDER` path
- store publish and island remount churn were reduced but were not the primary
  limiter in the captured history-scroll case
- the full-app trackpad bench now measures IOSurface layer presentation
  directly, and a coalesced synchronous scroll draw improved that presentation
  cadence materially
- a short-lived active-scroll draw pump now keeps synchronous draws running for
  the rest of a trackpad burst instead of stopping after the first run-loop turn
- repo-local validation is green for `validate-macos-ci.sh` and
  `swift test --build-path .build-codex --skip AppViewModelLiveManagedAgentTests`
- the only broad SwiftPM failure on this host is the live Claude probe in
  `AppViewModelLiveManagedAgentTests`, where `claude -p` times out/returns
  non-zero without output before the app assertions begin
- after granting automation permission, the SSH-launched macOS UI E2E rerun
  reaches test execution again and returns to the expected single remaining
  failure: `testMetadataEnabledPlainZshCodexPaneSurfacesManagedProviderAndActivity`
- the latest local trackpad/history bench on the improved build measured
  `scroll_to_layer_present_ms p50 1.765 / p95 18.782 / max 24.305`, down from
  the prior `p50 3.080 / p95 41.300 / max 58.542` on the installed build
