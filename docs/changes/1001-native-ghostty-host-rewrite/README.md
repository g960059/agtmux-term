This pack tracks the structural rewrite that moves terminal hosting away from
the legacy embedded scroll-pump path and toward a Ghostty-owned host model in
the same repository.

Current state:

- the old scroll investigation pack is retired; its accepted findings now live
  in the research note and perf runbook
- completed packs for unsigned release fallback and sidebar daemon binding are
  retired from `docs/changes/`
- phase 1 now has an explicit `TerminalHostMode` boundary:
  - `legacy` routes through `GhosttyIslandRepresentable`
  - `next` routes through a separate next-host controller boundary
- phase 1 next-host ownership now keeps pane-keyed child controllers with a
  capped retention set, so same-tile pane switches can move toward controller
  swap instead of same-surface reattach
- the obsolete replay/frontmost-AX scroll gates are retired in favor of:
  - the live-captured `curses-history` proxy
  - the frontmost live client-scroll parity gate
